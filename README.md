Senti-Bridge is a real-time data engineering dashboard designed to uncover hidden market opportunities by comparing asset prices against news sentiment.
Unlike traditional tools that simply display charts, Senti-Bridge acts as an automated analyst
.It scrapes live financial news using GoogleNews, processes it through a specialized Large Language Model (FinBERT),
and cross-references this sentiment with live stock data from yfinance.
The system identifies "Truth Gaps"—moments where the price action contradicts the fundamental news—alerting traders to potential market traps or overreactions.
